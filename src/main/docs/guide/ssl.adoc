This library supports connecting to MQTT brokers over SSL. Because that feature requires a third party dependency (Bouncy Castle), the functionality exists in a separate module that you must express a dependency on.

dependency:micronaut-mqtt-ssl[groupId="io.micronaut.mqtt"]

After adding the dependency, you must configure the client with the appropriate certificate authority, certificate, key, and password.

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.mqtt.ssl.MqttSslConfiguration.adoc[]

NOTE: The files can be configured with the `file:` prefix to reference absolute paths on the file system or `classpath:` to reference files on the classpath.

Once the configuration is in place the client will connect over SSL.

TIP: The server URI must start with `ssl:`.
